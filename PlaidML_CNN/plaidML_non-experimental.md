# Non-Experimental PlaidML Config

In this example I do not use the experimental hardware configuration for PlaidML. 

Still, run this command again if you ran it earlier, and make different choices.

```
plaidml-setup                                                   

```

Instead of saying `y` when asked about experimental configurations, I say `n`.

```

PlaidML Setup (0.7.0)

Thanks for using PlaidML!

The feedback we have received from our users indicates an ever-increasing need
for performance, programmability, and portability. During the past few months,
we have been restructuring PlaidML to address those needs.  To make all the
changes we need to make while supporting our current user base, all development
of PlaidML has moved to a branch â€” plaidml-v1. We will continue to maintain and
support the master branch of PlaidML and the stable 0.7.0 release.

Default Config Devices:
   llvm_cpu.0 : CPU (via LLVM)
   metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.1 : AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo (Metal)
   metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.0 : AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo (Metal)

Experimental Config Devices:
   llvm_cpu.0 : CPU (via LLVM)
   opencl_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo_compute_engine.1 : AMD AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo Compute Engine (OpenCL)
   opencl_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo_compute_engine.0 : AMD AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo Compute Engine (OpenCL)
   metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.1 : AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo (Metal)
   metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.0 : AMD Radeon Pro Vega II Duo (Metal)

Using experimental devices can cause poor performance, crashes, and other nastiness.

Enable experimental device support? (y,n)[n]:


```

You can see the experimental choices from earlier no longer exist: 

```

Multiple devices detected (You can override by setting PLAIDML_DEVICE_IDS).
Please choose a default device:

   1 : llvm_cpu.0
   2 : metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.1
   3 : metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.0

Default device? (1,2,3)[1]:2

Selected device:
    metal_amd_radeon_pro_vega_ii_duo.1

Almost done. Multiplying some matrices...
Tile code:
  function (B[X,Z], C[Z,Y]) -> (A) { A[x,y : X,Y] = +(B[x,z] * C[z,y]); }
Whew. That worked.

Save settings to /Users/gogginsS/.plaidml? (y,n)[y]:y
Success!

```
