# README.md for PlaidML_Fashion_mnist.ipydb
1. Create a python virtual environment using `venv` or `virtualenv`. For example, `virtualenv --python=python3 venv_name`
2. From within the PlaidML_CNN directory, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Setup PlaidML: You have two choices, experimental hardward and non-experimental hardware/software support. Notes for each I below, and I saved the results in the notebooks because, on my new Mac Pro, the experimental configuration was 0.1, compared to 0.9x for the non-experimental hardware configuration.

  - [Non-Experimental Configuration Notes](./plaidML_non-experimental.md)
4. Run `jupyter lab`
5. Have fun!
